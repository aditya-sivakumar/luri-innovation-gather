    <h3>3. Data Submitted via the GPT</h3>
    <p>When users interact with our GPT, any information they provide during the session (e.g., form data, text inputs) may be transmitted to and stored in third-party services like Google Sheets via Make.com. This may include sensitive data depending on what users input into the GPT.</p>

    <h3>4. Third-Party Integration Data</h3>
    <p>Our GPT uses Make.com to integrate with services like Google Sheets. As a result, information submitted via the GPT is transmitted to those third-party services, where it is processed and stored. We do not control how third-party services handle your data and recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these services.</p>

        <li>To monitor and improve the Serviceâ€™s performance, reliability, and user experience.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations and resolve any disputes or security concerns.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We share your information only as described in this policy:</p>

    <h3>1. Third-Party Integrations</h3>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy or as required by law. Once it is no longer needed, we will either delete or anonymize the data.</p>
